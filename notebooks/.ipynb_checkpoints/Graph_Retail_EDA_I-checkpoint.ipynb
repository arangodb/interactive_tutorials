    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph analytics can useful in the analysis of retail data. This series of notebook will explore the utility of ideas from graph analytics to analyze data from an online retail store. The store has many infrequent shoppers and a group of loyal shoppers who make purchases at the store often. This study focusses on the group of loyal customers. This group has several attractive features that make it a good candidate to analyze. It is the group for which we have sufficient data describing their shopping behavior. It is also a group that is profitable from business standpoint. They generate revenue for the store. Understanding the shopping preferences of this group can help create better shopping expereiences at the store. See [this article](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/why-consumer-behavior-analysis-is-so-relevant-to-the-ecommerce-business-8f49c250ca9c), for example, for some of the reasons why understanding consumer behavior is important in the retail industry. Ideas from graph analytics can be applied to capture critical aspects of customer behavior and product purchase behavior that can leveraged for profit. Extracting analytical insights from the data require, the at the very least, the following:\n",
    "1. Identification of a set of analytical tools that can help extract these insights.\n",
    "2. Transformation of the raw data to a representation that is required by these analytical tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph analytics can be leveraged for the first task. This requires representing the customer purchases at the store in the form of a graph. A particular type of graph structure, a _bi-partite_ graph, is a particularly useful graph representation to extract insights about customer purchasing behavior at the store. Data analysis tools can be leveraged for the second task. The first two notebooks in this series will focus on the data analysis tasks. The next two notebooks will focus on the application of graph analytic tools to extract insights about customer behavior.\n",
    "The data that is analyzed in this series of notebooks are transactions from the store. The data is available in the [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II). A schematic illustrating the methodology that will be used in this series of posts is shown below  ![workflow](img/analysis_methodology.png)"

    "Consistent with the approach discussed above, the implementation of the notebooks follows a four-step approach. The first two steps illustrate the characteristics of the data and transform the raw data to a form where we can apply graph analytics. The last two steps illustrate the application of ideas from graph analytics to extract insights about customer purchase behavior. The schematic consists of four blocks. The title of each block captures the main functional idea performed by that block. Key features and ideas captured by a functional block are mentioned in the list at the bottom of the block. The representation of the data changes as we work through this four-step process. The circular block elements capture the nature of the data as we work through this process."

This idea will be used later in this work. For now, the relevant fact is that the number of customer visits to the store is an important metric in the analysis of retail data. Since we are in an online setting, the number of store visits is approximated as the number of invoices the customer generates at the store. The number of customer visits can be obtained by grouping by customer ID and then counting the number of unique invoices for the customer"

    "One of the objectives for this work is to understand the frequent shopper groups preferences for store items. An intrinsic feature of the user-item utility matrix is that a user is a high-dimensional representation. The frequent shopper group purchases  2765  store items. The median value of items a customer purchases at the store is  110 . The dimensionality on the other hand is  2765 . This implies that for most customers, the representation is going to have a high proportion of zero values. Such a representation is called a sparse representation. Since one of the objectives of this work is to understand the nature of customer shopping preferences, a feature selection model based on a linear regression model is used to identify the pool of store items that can capture the customer value at the store. The details of developing this model are provided in the next set of illustration. In developing the data representation of the customer, a data preparation step in light of this downstream modeling activity is relavant. This step pertains to removing correlated attributes from the customer representation. Linear models are affected by a phenomenon called multi-collinearity, a condition that manifests when we have attributes that are highly correlated with each other. Multi-collinearity presents computational difficulties in estimating linear models. To prevent multi-collinearity, when we have highly correlated columns, we retain one of the columns and drop the other. In this work a threshold of  0.8  is used to screen the correlated columns in the user-item utility matrix. The details of removing the correlated items are shown below."

To compute this, the most recent date in the data is used as a reference date. The time period that has elapsed between the customer's last visit to the store, as available from the customer's newest invoice,  and this reference date represents the time interval, $\\Delta T$, between the customer's last visit and the reference data. This time interval, $\\Delta T$, does not have the qualities we want from an attribute that captures recency. $\\Delta T$, is small for customers whose last visit is very close to the most recent date and large for customers whose last vist is a large time period from the most recent date. We want the recency attribute to have the opposite of this behavior. Customers who visited the store close to the most recent date should have a high value and customers who visited store a while from the most recent date should have a low value. We can get this characteristic by defining: $$recency = \\frac{1}{\\Delta T}$$.   \n",
