    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the descriptive features of the frequent customer group. These features are obtained by applying graph analytic concepts to the frequent customer group. To do so, we need to represent the frequent customer group as a graph. In particular, this group is modeled as a bi-partite graph with the customer nodes and item nodes forming the two disjoint vertex sets. The purchase of an item by a customer as part of an invoice is modeled as an edge.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook will use ideas from:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    [Statistical Analysis of Network Data](https://bigdata.unl.edu/documents/ASA_Workshop_Materials/Tutorial%20Statistical%20Analysis%20of%20Network%20Data.pdf): Provides a methodology for characterizing network structure\n",
    "2.   [Basic Notions for the Analysis of Affiliate Networks](https://github.com/arangoml/networkx-adapter/blob/master/bipartite_clustering.pdf) : Provides a methodology for analyzing bi-partite graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive characteristics of the graph are captured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Vertex and Edge Characteristics\n",
    "2.   Network Cohesion\n",
    "\n",
    "These perspectives are important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   They provide insights about customer behavior or the concept modeled by the graph\n",
    "2.   They provide the basis for developing other machine learning tasks for the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may be interested in the following:\n",
    "*   How can we develop a generative model for the graph? \n",
    "*   How do we model the formation of links in the network?\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks tell us how customers make purchases. For details of developing a generative model on bipartite graphs, see [Bipartite Graphs as Models of Complex Networks](http://denif.ens-lyon.fr/data/algorithmique_reseaux_telecoms_enslyon/2007/cours/biparti.pdf) and [Measuring and Modeling Bipartite Graphs with Community Structure](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1561802). Developing these models requires the descriptive characterization of the graph, which is what is done in this notebook. This chararacterization provides information about properties such as degree distribution and clustering characteristics of nodes which are used to develop the models discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While summary statistics and distributions can be used to provide one descriptive perspective of the network (vertex and edge characteristics), information about grouping characteristics provides the complimentary perspective (network-cohesion). There are multiple ways to describe network-cohension. In this notebook, we will describe two ways to capture or describe cohesive tendencies in the notebook. These are the number of connected components in the graph and measurements describing clique formation in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook will provide the implementation of the methodology discussed here. There is one other conceptual idea that we require in the toolbox for the analysis of bi-partite graphs. This is the notion of a _projected graph_.  The two disjoint vertex sets are called the top and bottom vertex sets. The choice of which set to call the top set is arbitrary. It is possible to determine a _projection_ of a set of vertices belonging to either the top or bottom vertex set onto the opposite vertex set. In other words, it is possible to _project_ a set of top vertices on to the bottom vertex set, or, vice versa. The projection of the top set of vertices on to the bottom set, we connect two vertices of the bottom set in the projected graph if they are linked by a vertex in the opposite set. An example graph and the projection graph of the top set of vertices to the bottom set is shown below.\n",

The size of the clique captures the items they buy in common. Analogously, a clique in the item projection graph represents items that are purchased together. A clique can be identified using a K-Core of the graph. A K-Core of the graph represents a subgraph where the degree of each degree is at least K. To identify the largest clique we will start with the K set to the maximum degree and check if we can find a K core, if we cannot find a clique, we decrement K till we reach a K where a K core is found.
