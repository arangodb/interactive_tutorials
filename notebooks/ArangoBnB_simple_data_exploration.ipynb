        "\n",
        "This notebook showcases an example of data exploration as a part of a data modeling activity. The original dataset is pulled from and maintained by [insideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). The goal is to show a different approach to data analysis and exploration, compared to AQL. The approaches should not be considered contradictory but instead complimentary. This notebook focuses on some basic overview data and some insights into the prices of listings. A more complete look at the listings of the Airbnb dataset can be found in the original article.\n",
        "\n",
        "This data was eventually used in the full stack JavaScript project, [ArangoBnB](https://github.com/cw00dw0rd/ArangoBnB). The ArangoBnB project has been created with the community and is always open to new contributors looking to learn more about ArangoDB, JavaScript, Vue, and/or React.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some objectives for this data exploration activity includes:\n",
        " * Learn about the included fields and data types\n",
        " * Evaluate completeness of the fields\n",
        " * Determine if the data can fulfill our application requirements\n",
        " * Attempt to gain some quick insights from listing prices\n",
        " * Discover any necessary transformations\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Application Requirements\n",
        "The following is a list of application requirements that were previously outlined in the associated data modeling article. During the activity we hope to determine the viability of some of these features. It isn't likely that we will find all features listed in this single file but it's a good idea to keep them in mind.\n",
        " * Search an AirBnB dataset to find rentals nearby a specified location\n",
        " * A draggable map that shows results based on position\n",
        " * Use ArangoSearch to keep everything fast\n",
        " * Search the dataset with GeoJSON coordinates\n",
        " * Filter results based on keywords, price, guests, etc\n",
        " * Natural language search (Ex: Houses in Florida with pools.)\n",
        " * Use AQL for all queries\n",
        " * Multi-lingual support\n"
