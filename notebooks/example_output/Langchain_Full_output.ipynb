        "> LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM-based applications which benefit from context augmentation. Such LLM systems have been termed as RAG systems, standing for “Retrieval-Augmented Generation”. LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data in order to inject these safely and reliably into LLMs for more accurate text generation\n",

        "LLMs are trained on enormous bodies of data but they aren’t trained on your data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solves this problem by adding your data to the data LLMs already have access to.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are five key stages within RAG, which in turn will be a part of any larger application you build. These are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Loading**: this refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database, or an API - into your pipeline. LlamaHub provides hundreds of connectors to choose from.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Indexing**: this means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Storing**: once your data is indexed you will almost always want to store your index, as well as other metadata, to avoid having to re-index it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Querying**: for any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and LlamaIndex data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries and hybrid strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluation**: a critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures of how accurate, faithful and fast your responses to queries are.\n",
