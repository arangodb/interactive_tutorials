    "The following notebook is a simple example of how to detect shifts in your dataset using the arangopipe API. This example takes parts of the same dataset and compares them to each other, in a non-random fashion. The purpose of this is to show how the dataset shift API functions and the process of comparing parts of the same dataset is only for demonstration purposes. You would typically use a new or updated dataset to check the reliablity of the model against your new data."

    "## Interpretation of the score reported by the shift detector\n",
    "The API uses a classifier to discriminate between the datasets provided to it. The score reported by the API is the accuracy of the classifier to discriminate between the datasets. Values close to  0.5  indicate that the classifier is not able to discriminate between the two datasets. This could be interpreted as a situation where no discernable shift has occurred in the data since the last model deployment. Values close to 1 indicate that the dataset shift is detectable, and we may need to revisit modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "How the dataset shift affects the performance of the deployed model is problem-dependent. So we must assess the score in the context of a particular application. Usually, we perform experiments to determine a threshold value of the dataset shift score; the score represents an acceptable level of drift.\n",

    "This post introduced covariate shifts in datasets and provided an example of how easy it is to test this with ArangoML’s built-in API.
