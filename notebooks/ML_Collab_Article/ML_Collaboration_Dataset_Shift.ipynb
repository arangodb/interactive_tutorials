        "The API uses a classifier to discriminate between the datasets provided to it. The score reported by the API is the accuracy of the classifier to discriminate between the datasets. Values close to  0.5  indicate that the classifier is not able to discriminate between the two datasets. This could be interpreted as a situation where no discernable shift has occurred in the data since the last model deployment. Values close to 1 indicate that the dataset shift is detectable, and we may need to revisit modeling. \n",
        "\n",
        "How the dataset shift affects the performance of the deployed model is problem-dependent. So we must assess the score in the context of a particular application. Usually, we perform experiments to determine a threshold value of the dataset shift score; the score represents an acceptable level of drift.\n",
