Model selection is an important activity for data scientists. Data scientists consider many candidate models for a task and then the best performing model is chosen. An example of this can be found in the hyperopt guide to capture metadata from a hyper-parameter tuning experiment, (see [hyperopt](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/arangopipe/tests/hyperopt/hyperopt_integration.ipynb)). We will use a simpler setting for this notebook. We will assume model selection has been completed and that a LASSO regression model is the best candidate for the task. Having made this decision, we capture information about the model and its parameters. This information is stored in Arangopipe. The details of performing these tasks are shown below. Before model building, we capture information related to the dataset and the features used to build the model."
